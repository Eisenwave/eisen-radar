EisenRadar is a plugin which allows you to create configurable boss-bar radars for your worlds. You can do this easily through both commands and configuration files.

[B][SIZE=5]Performance[/SIZE][/B]
EisenRadar draws all radar bars asynchronously from the main thread. This means that you can have hundreds of players viewing a radar bar without your server's main functions being delayed.

[B][SIZE=5]Stability[/SIZE][/B]
EisenRadar saves all of its radars whenever the world saves. This means that you won't lose any of your custom waypoints if the server crashes.

[B][SIZE=5]Localization[/SIZE][/B]
When you add language files to your [B]plugins/EisenRadar/lang[/B] folder, players who are using the same languages will receive your custom messages.

Example: If a German player (using language [B]de_de.lang[/B] in their resource pack) joins the server, messages from [B]lang/de_de.lang[/B] on your server will be sent to them.

EisenRadar automatically detects the locale of players and chooses the right messages for them.

[B][SIZE=5]Update Information[/SIZE][/B]
The plugin automatically informs operators if a new version has been released after they join the server.

In this screenshot you can see a very simple radar. The radar has dots at the cardinal directions (N,E,S,W) and a small [B]x[/B] marking the world's origin by default.

[B]x[/B] and [B]W[/B] are visible because the player is looking into the west and the origin of the world is westwards of them. The colored dots [B][COLOR=#ff0000]P[/COLOR][/B] and [B][COLOR=#0080ff]Z[/COLOR][/B] are custom dots, added by the player.

This screenshot shows example output of the [B]/radar list[/B] command.

EisenRadar uses only a single command to avoid clashes with other plugins. That command is [B][FONT=Courier New]/radar[/FONT][/B].

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar add <id> <symbol> (<yaw>|<x> <z>)[/FONT][/B]
Adds a radar dot with a given symbol and yaw or location.
[B][FONT=Arial]Example:[/FONT] [/B][FONT=Courier New]/radar add waypoint1 &cX 1 2[/FONT]
Adds a dot named "waypoint1" with the symbol [COLOR=#ff0000]X[/COLOR] at x=1, z=2.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar edit <id> infrange (true|false)[/FONT][/B]
Sets whether an existing radar dot should bypass the waypoint range of the world. If so, it will always be displayed, no matter how far the player is. This setting is meaningless for fixed-yaw radar dots.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar edit <id> symbol <symbol>[/FONT][/B]
Edits the symbol of an existing radar dot with a given id in your world.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar edit <id> pos (<yaw>|<x> <z>)[/FONT][/B]
Edits the position of an existing radar dot with a given id in your world. If you provide one number for the position, it will be displayed at a fixed angle (yaw). If you provide two numbers, the dot will be displayed at a fixed location in the world.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar list[/FONT][/B]
Lists all radar dots in your world.
For an example output, look into the screenshots section.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar on[/FONT][/B]
Turns your radar on.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar off[/FONT][/B]
Turns your radar off.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar remove <id>[/FONT][/B]
Removes a dot with a given id.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar settings wprange [infinite|<range>][/FONT][/B]
Displays the current waypoint range or sets it, if a range is provided. The range can either be the literal "inf" or "infinite" or it can be a positive real number.

[B][FONT=Courier New]/radar toggle[/FONT][/B]
Toggles your radar on or off. If your radar is on, it will be disabled. If your radar is off, it will be enabled.

This is the default plugin config.
[CODE=yaml]
# the amount of ticks to wait between each radar bar update
# at least 1, values below will be clamped
# TIP: the lower the period, the smoother the radar bar will feel to players
# TIP: if you are experiencing performance issues, increasing the period can reduce lag
period: 1

# radar options
radar:

  # the field of view
  # between 0 and 360, values outside this range will be clamped
  fov: 90

  # the amount of characters that the radar content will take up
  # at least 0, values below will be clamped
  # TIP: use an uneven number so that radar dots can be positioned directly in the center of the bar
  size: 31

# boss bar options
bossbar:

  # the color of the boss bar
  # pick one from: BLUE | GREEN | PINK | PURPLE | RED | WHITE | YELLOW
  color: BLUE

  # the style of the boss bar
  # pick one from: SEGMENTED_6 | SEGMENTED_10 | SEGMENTED_12 | SEGMENTED_20 | SOLID
  style: SEGMENTED_6

  # list of boss bar flags (may be empty)
  # pick multiple from: CREATE_FOG | DARKEN_SKY | PLAY_BOSS_MUSIC
  flags: []

  # bar percentage
  # between 0 and 100, values outside this range will be clamped
  progress: 0[/CODE]

EisenRadar stores all its radar dots in [B]plugins/EisenRadar/radars/<world_name>.yml[/B]. Here is an example of such a file:
[CODE=yaml]dots:
  east:
    symbol: E
    yaw: 270.0
  south:
    symbol: '&9S'
    yaw: 0.0
  north:
    symbol: '&cN'
    yaw: 180.0
  origin:
    symbol: '&lx'
    x: 0.0
    z: 0.0
  west:
    symbol: W
    yaw: 90.0
  point:
    symbol: '&c&lP'
    x: 96.0
    z: 64.0
  point2:
    symbol: '&9&lZ'
    x: 96.0
    z: 0.0[/CODE]
It is possible to edit these files by hand and edit, remove and add radar dots that way, however [U]DO NOT[/U] do this when the server is running, else your files will be overwritten.
